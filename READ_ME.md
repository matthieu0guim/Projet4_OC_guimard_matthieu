## Execution
### How to implement the virtual environment:
The first step is to create a virtual environment in order to install the required libraries.

1- create your environment with the command "py -m venv env"

2- activate it with the command "env\script\activate"

3- install the needed libraries with the command "pip install -r requirements.txt"

### Script execution
Get into the correct folder using terminal command. Then run the following command.

```sh
python main.py 
```
The user will have the main menue displayed in the terminal.
To begin an action, the user has to enter an integer corresponding to the action.

To shut the programm down, the user just has to press "Ctrl + c" in the terminal.

### Generate a flake8-html report.
This action shall be executed either on a separated terminal or with the programm not running.
Get into the correct folder using terminal command. Then run the following command.

```sh
flake8 --format=html --htmldir=flake-report
```
--htmldir=flake-report will create a new folder with all html files. The user can give it the name he wants by changing "flake-report" designation.
